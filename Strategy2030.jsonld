    "comment": "Summary\n\nYoroi votes YES on the Info Action titled “Cardano 2030: Vision, Mission, Strategy Framework and KPIs” as an initial step toward better alignment and more strategic decision-making across the ecosystem.\n\nRationale\n\nA starting point for shared direction\n\nThis proposal serves as a meaningful foundation for aligning community efforts around a common long-term outlook. As governance responsibilities increasingly sit with DReps, having a shared strategic reference helps make voting decisions more intentional.\n\nSignals a shift toward real-world impact\n\nThe focus on usage-based core KPIs such as transactions, active wallets, and total value-locked reflects a positive move toward measuring real adoption and ecosystem relevance, rather than progress defined purely by technical delivery.\n\nGuidance, not enforcement\n\nAs a non-binding Info Action, the framework informs decisions without constraining them. While the details can be refined over time, treating this as an initial step allows the community to move forward with a shared direction while remaining open to iteration.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Yoroi supports this proposal as a constructive first step toward a shared long-term strategy that helps DReps make more strategic and explainable decisions, while leaving room for improvement as the ecosystem evolves. As this framework is iterated on, clearer articulation of nearer-term KPI expectations would further enhance its usefulness for evaluating proposals within individual budget cycles."
