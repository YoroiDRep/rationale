This proposal represents a practical and forward-looking move that benefits the entire ecosystem.\n\nProtecting Cardano’s Digital Identity:\nSecuring the .ada and .cardano domains ensures that Cardano’s name and brand are protected from misuse or external control, reinforcing trust and long-term credibility across the ecosystem.\n\nEcosystem Benefit:\nCardano Foundation’s decision to fund this initiative using its own resources demonstrates accountability and stewardship. This approach safeguards community resources while still delivering an ecosystem-wide benefit.\n\nConclusion\nYoroi DRep votes YES with confidence and appreciation for this responsible, community-minded initiative. The action protects Cardano’s brand, strengthens its digital footprint, and sets a positive precedent for proactive, transparent governance decisions that serve the ecosystem’s long-term interests."
