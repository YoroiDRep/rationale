    "comment": "Summary\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES on the governance action to adopt Cardano Constitution v2.4. This decision reflects our assessment that the revisions in this version directly address the concerns we raised in v2.3 and restore clarity in key areas of governance and accountability.\n\nRationale\n\n• Audit Requirements\n\nThe proposal reverts audit-related provisions to the v1.0 wording, resolving our previous concerns regarding ambiguity over responsibility, funding, and execution. Returning to language that is already operational and familiar within the ecosystem removes the uncertainty introduced in v2.3.\n\n• Custodian Consent and ADA Ownership\n\nRevisions made in v2.3 around custodial authority and terminology have been rolled back. The restoration of “ADA owner” terminology and the reversion of custodial provisions to their v1.0 form directly address our concerns around user consent and the potential concentration of governance power among custodial entities.\n\nConclusion\n\nYoroi’s YES vote reflects recognition that the proposal has substantively responded to previously raised concerns and represents a constructive step forward from the current v1.0 Constitution. We view the Constitution as a living document that will continue to benefit from iterative refinement, and we thank Yuta for his responsiveness, openness to feedback, and continued leadership in guiding this process."
