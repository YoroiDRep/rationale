    "comment": "Summary\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES on the proposal to increase Plutus memory unit limits for transactions and blocks. The adjustment improves smart contract flexibility and user experience without introducing material risk to network stability.\n\nRationale\n\n• Developer constraint relief with low risk\nIncreasing memory limits allows Plutus scripts to perform more meaningful work within a single transaction, reducing forced transaction splitting and improving developer and user experience without reflecting capacity pressure on the network.\n\n• Well tested and performance safe\nBenchmarking by IOE’s Performance and Tracing team, along with validation on Preview and PreProd testnets, confirms that the proposed increases preserve Praos timing guarantees and maintain sufficient performance headroom.\n\n• Governance compliant and incrementally staged\nThe proposal is recommended by Intersect’s Parameter Committee, ratified by the Technical Steering Committee, and fully aligned with Constitutional guardrails. As the first step of a staged approach, it does not pre-commit the ecosystem to future increases, which must be evaluated independently.\n\nConclusion\nYoroi supports this proposal as a safe, well tested parameter update that improves usability while maintaining Cardano’s reliability and operational stability."
