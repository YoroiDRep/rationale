    "comment": "Summary\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES to the “Add Constitutional Committee Member” governance action, bringing the Constitutional Committee (CC) back to full strength, allowing Cardano on-chain governance to move forward.\n\nRationale\n\nCC back to working capacity\nAfter a recent resignation, the committee fell under the minimum size set in protocol. With only six members, the CC cannot approve most governance actions. This vote fixes that gap by restoring the required member count.\n\nRespecting the snap election outcome\n\nIntersect ran a snap election to fill the empty seat, and Cardano Curia emerged as the top choice. Yoroi supports recognizing that result on-chain and is confident that the new member can uphold the constitutional role with integrity. \n\nConclusion\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES because restoring the CC is urgent for governance continuity, and the chosen member reflects a valid community decision."
