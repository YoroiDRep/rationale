    "comment": "Summary\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES on the governance action to fund “₳5M Loan for Cardano’s Global Listing Expansion - Powered by SNEK.”\n\nRationale\n\nNew model of accountability: This is the first loan-based Treasury request, adding a new dimension to governance by complementing the existing grant-based model, with repayment at 2.44% APR to strengthen fiscal responsibility.\n\nProven execution capacity: SNEK has already self-funded $4.5M and successfully secured Tier 1 listings on Kraken, Crypto.com, and KuCoin, demonstrating credibility and delivery track record.\n\nEcosystem-wide benefit: Expanding SNEK listings also expands ADA liquidity, increases Cardano’s visibility in mainstream markets, and builds reusable legal/technical frameworks for future Cardano native tokens.\n\nConclusion\n\nYoroi DRep supports this governance action as a step forward in responsible Treasury usage. In the next Treasury Withdrawal governance action, however, we expect the proposers to provide a clear repayment plan and more detailed success metrics to ensure accountability and measurable ecosystem impact.\n"
