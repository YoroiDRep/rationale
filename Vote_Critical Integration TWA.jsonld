    "comment": "Summary\n\nEMURGO, as a DRep, votes YES on the treasury withdrawal governance action titled “Withdraw ₳70,000,000 for Cardano Critical Integrations Budget,” for the reasons outlined below.\n\nRationale\n\nThis decision aligns with our earlier YES vote and rationale for the corresponding Budget Info Action (gov_action13a2dqgwxum7d6kjfprcs57cf9733ek2dkt5qnuhqd4ll5ntcwu7sqluwkxd). The community has shown strong momentum and conviction around this budget. The BIA surpassed 50 percent DRep approval at an exceptional pace just a few days after launch, signaling both clear agreement on the direction and a shared urgency to move into execution.\n\nWe also observe that this momentum has continued to build. This is reinforced by the community-initiated extension of the 2025 NCL, which has also surpassed 50 percent DRep support, alongside overwhelming backing from multiple directions across the ecosystem. Together, these signals reflect a growing consensus that Cardano critical integrations are not optional enhancements, but a core requirement for ecosystem reliability, adoption, and long-term scalability.\n\nIn this context, the treasury withdrawal is the necessary operational follow-through on a priority that the community has already validated. It also reflects the trust placed in the pentad to carry this mission forward, a responsibility we take very seriously. For these reasons, EMURGO votes YES."
