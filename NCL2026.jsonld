    "comment": "Summary\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES on the Net Change Limit (NCL) 2026 proposal, which sets a maximum treasury withdrawal limit of 350,000,000 ADA for the specified period. We support establishing a clear and well-defined limit to enable transparent and predictable governance for ADA holders.\n\nRationale\n\nPurpose and Scope of the Net Change Limit\n\nThis proposal establishes the maximum amount that may be withdrawn from the treasury during the specified period. Approval of the NCL does not authorize spending, but instead defines the boundary within which individual treasury withdrawal proposals may be evaluated and voted on.\n\nClarity of Intent and Context for the Proposed Amount\n\nThe proposed limit takes into account a previously approved Budget Info Action, namely Stablecoin DeFi Liquidity Budget. Acknowledging these prior approvals helps clarify that the proposed NCL is intended to accommodate known commitments, rather than signal automatic or unrestricted spending.\n\nTimeline and Community Predictability\n\nAligning the NCL period with the mid-year budget cycle improves predictability around when treasury-related decisions are likely to occur. This makes it easier for the Cardano community to follow governance developments and engage with the process in a timely manner.\n\nConclusion\n\nYoroi supports this Info Action as a clear and reasonable guardrail that allows treasury governance to proceed in a predictable and accountable manner. We thank the Budget Committee for preparing this proposal and supporting the continuity of treasury governance."
