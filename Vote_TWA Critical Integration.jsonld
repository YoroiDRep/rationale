    "comment": "Summary\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES on the treasury withdrawal “Withdraw ₳70,000,000 for Cardano Critical Integrations Budget.” This withdrawal is the needed step to unlock funding for critical integrations already endorsed by the community.\n\nRationale\n\nFrom community approval to execution\n\nYoroi views this withdrawal as the concrete follow-through on funding that DReps have already supported via the related Budget Info Action. The swift and decisive backing for that earlier signal, alongside the community-approved extension of the 2025 NCL with similarly strong DRep support, shows the ecosystem is aligned on this priority and ready to move into delivery. Critical integrations such as stablecoin, oracle connectivity, cross-chain access, institutional-grade custody, wallet infrastructure, and on-chain analytics are essential building blocks for deeper liquidity, stronger DeFi and RWA activity, and long-term adoption on Cardano.\n\nEnhanced transparency strengthens confidence\n\nWhile the governance and oversight model stays consistent with the Budget Info Action, the treasury withdrawal increases trust by delivering the high-level allocation breakdown that the BIA deferred and by directly addressing DRep feedback on transparency within NDA limits. This reduces uncertainty around how the ₳70M will be allocated and supports stronger accountability as execution begins.\n\nConclusion\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES because this withdrawal will fund critical integrations that the community has already backed through the Budget Info Action, which Yoroi also supported. The Treasury Withdrawal strengthens confidence by providing a clear, high-level budget breakdown and directly addressing DRep transparency concerns, making execution feel more accountable."
