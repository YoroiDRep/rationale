    "comment": "Summary\n\nYoroi DRep votes NO on the governance action to fund the Cardano Global Listing Expansion initiative by the Snek Foundation.\n\nRationale\nThe proposal highlights a proven and driven team with a history of delivering Tier 1 listings and building CNT adoption. These contributions have brought visibility to Cardano that is rare among community-led projects.\n\nThe current request, however, lacks a clear funding structure that ensures tangible returns for the ecosystem or a framework that other projects can directly reuse. Treasury resources should prioritize proposals with both specific deliverables and lasting community benefits.\n\nThe listed withdrawal amount of 5 ADA is clearly insufficient for the stated goals, indicating the need for a corrected submission.\n\nConclusion\nWe encourage the proposers to return with an updated plan that outlines realistic costs, defines ecosystem-wide benefits, and includes mechanisms that provide lasting value beyond a single asset. Yoroi would welcome the opportunity to review such a resubmission on its merits."
