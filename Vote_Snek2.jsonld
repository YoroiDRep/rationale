    "comment": "Summary\nYoroi DRep votes NO on the governance action to fund the proposal titled Withdraw â‚³5M for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek\n\nRationale\nThe proposal highlights a proven and driven team with a history of delivering Tier 1 listings and building CNT adoption. These contributions have brought visibility to Cardano that is rare among community-led projects.\nThe current request, however, lacks a clear funding structure that ensures tangible returns for the ecosystem or a framework that other projects can directly reuse. Treasury resources should prioritize proposals that offer both specific deliverables and lasting community benefits.\n\nConclusion\nWe encourage Snek Foundation to return with an updated plan, starting with an info budget action as defined in the constitution, which establishes ecosystem-wide benefits, and includes mechanisms that provide lasting value beyond a single asset."
