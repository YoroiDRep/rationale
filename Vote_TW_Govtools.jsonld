    "comment": "Summary:\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES on the governance action to fund GovTool – Treasury Withdrawal for 12 months of active maintenance and development, following the previously approved Budget Info Action (gov_action1n5sn54mgf47a7men2ryq6ppx88kta4wvenz2qkl4f9v6ppje8easqxwm88m) for ₳1.15M.\n\nRationale:\n\nThis withdrawal faithfully aligns with the intent of the approved Info Action that Yoroi DRep supported. It maintains the same scope, community-owned model, and transparent execution through Intersect’s smart contract framework.\n\nThe proposal now includes clearer delivery assurance, milestone verification, and oversight through independent third parties, strengthening accountability and constitutional compliance.\n\nConclusion:\n\nYoroi DRep reaffirms its support for GovTool as essential governance infrastructure and votes YES, recognizing the improved operational framework and sustained alignment with Cardano’s principles of openness and community participation."
