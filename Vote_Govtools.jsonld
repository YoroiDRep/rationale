    "comment": "Summary:\n\nYoroi DRep votes YES on the governance action to fund Cardano GovTool – Budget for 12 months of full active maintenance and development.\nRationale:\n\nGovTool is a critical, open-source governance infrastructure that supports the full on-chain process from DRep registration to proposal submission, voting, and outcomes. It aligns closely with Cardano’s CIPs, community-first ethos, and does not pursue commercial interests.\nThe team responded transparently and promptly to recent bugs, expanding test coverage, refactoring outdated modules, and improving debugging workflows. These improvements, combined with a growing contributor base, reflect clear lessons learned from past challenges.\n\nConclusion:\nYoroi DRep acknowledges that GovTool still has areas for improvement, particularly in delivery structure and operational clarity. However, we support this proposal because we believe in its mission, its community alignment, and its evolving commitment to reliability and transparency."
